I use the **explorers** domain to try out and tinker with new frameworks and APIs.   

This project contains the base model of this domain.

It contains :
* in _model/_ the base model classes and enums
* in _dao/_ the interfaces defining the various daos available
* in _dao/impl/_ a sample implementation of the daos using in memory hashmaps
* in _rest/_ the interfaces defining the various rest endpoints available
* in _utils/_ various utilities such as a sample data generator
* to be completed...
